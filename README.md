Size Acceptance and Body Positivity Advocacy Website
This project is a web-based platform designed to promote size acceptance and body positivity, aiming to raise awareness and foster social change. The website features educational resources such as articles and videos, alongside an interactive petition where users can actively support the cause. The petition functionality encourages visitors to voice their support, making advocacy accessible and actionable. By combining compelling content with a seamless user experience, this project serves as both an educational tool and a rallying point for social activism.

The platform was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly interface. Key skills demonstrated in this project include front-end development, responsive design, and user interaction enhancement. From designing the structure of the website to implementing dynamic elements, this project showcases the integration of technical skills with a commitment to driving impactful social initiatives. Future updates aim to expand the site's capabilities, such as adding data analytics to track petition engagement and additional features to further amplify its reach.
